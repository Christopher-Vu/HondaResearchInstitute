# Fail2Drive dev search on SimLingo: every variant tried

Chris, 2026-11-12: iterate freely on SimLingo's Fail2Drive test pool, log every variant here as it is submitted,
report what we have at any point. The working target is (b): an activation method beats B3 (behavioural) on the
B4-unnamed gaps. TransFuser++'s test pool is the held-out confirmation, scored once after the method is frozen.
Budget 800 SU.

Pool: `results/savio/f2d-test-simlingo/` (1,188 scored routes). Gaps (pre-registered classification,
`docs/prereg-fail2drive.md`): PedestriansOnRoad, FullyBlocked, BadParking, all B4-unnamed (`b4-split.json`).
CustomObstacles (background, open post hoc decision) and Wall (ceiling) are scored beside them for reference.
Scores choose the best axis using the gap's failing set (as H22).

| id | date | change from H22 | job | SU | result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| v1 | 2026-11-12 | none but the pool: H22's pipeline, layer 10, plain/centre/vision, 18 dictionaries; M1 floor 20 (H22) and 5 (as H23's direction) | | | |
