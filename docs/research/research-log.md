# Research log

Decision timeline for the planted-gap recovery goal. Newest entry at the bottom. Times are Pacific.

**Goal (from Jerry):** prove the discovery SDK finds failures we planted in CARLA, explain how, keep an extensive
log, end with an explainer video; 6,000 SU allowed.

**Where we start (measured earlier today):** three planted camera faults pass their full pilots: P4 occlusion
(43/60 slice failures vs 12/60), P7 freeze (53/56 vs 15/60), P8 latency (58/58 vs 12/60). Shards with layer means
exist for all of them and for 384 background rollouts.

**Why the earlier attempt failed:** the first dev evaluation (2026-10-15) had P4 as 70% of failures, so an axis of
every failure scored 0.70 and no method could beat that. With P7, P8 and both background waves pooled, each planted
gap is roughly a fifth of the failures, so a catch-all scores about 0.2 and real recovery can show.

**Decision:** lock H1's protocol before touching data (`experiments/h1-planted-gap-recovery/protocol.md`), then
build the mechanical code the 2026-10-22 spec listed as missing. Savio's login dropped at about 22:30, so the run
waits for the user; code and tests go first.
